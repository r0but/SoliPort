# SoliPort
This is an attempt to modify my game, Soliton, to use the SFML graphics library instead of a command terminal. I am working on a complete rewrite of it as well, but for now, this is a quick and dirty solution to have something cool to show while I create a cleaner codebase.

For the original game, please visit github.com/r0but/Soliton.
